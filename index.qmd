This is a companion book to the [HSItools](https://mzarowka.github.io/HSItools/ "https://mzarowka.github.io/HSItools/") R package, aiming at processing and visualizing hyperspectral scanning data.

Maurycy Żarczyński, David C. Edge, Nick P. McKay, and Paul D. Zander developed the package with the community's help.

The current requirements to run HSItools are as follows:

-   R: \>= 4.1.0 is necessary because we depend on the native R pipe and lambda functions introduced with R 4.1.0.
-   Rtools (on Windows): \>= 4.0 [\[link\]](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools40.html "Rtools on CRAN")
-   QGIS (optionally but heavily encouraged): [\[link\]](https://www.qgis.org "https://www.qgis.org")

These downloads and installation take some time, depending on the Internet speed and your Operating System.

## Installation

{HSItools} is currently in development and available only from GitHub.

::: callout-tip
## Package installation

We are using {pak} for installation from remote sources.
:::

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Install pak if necessary
install.packages("pak")

# Install HSItools
pak::pak("mzarowka/HSItools")
```

## QGIS

In our workflow we delegate some of the work to GIS environment, especially marking the raster files, selecting regions and so on. We strongly suggest an Open Source tool like QGIS, however any GIS software, such as ESRI ArcGIS Pro should suffice.

You can find the latest version of QGIS here: <https://www.qgis.org>
