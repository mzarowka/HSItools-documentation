# Extracting the data

Once you're happy with your indices and plots, you can also extract the underlying data.

## Index profile

You can extract the data that was used to plot this curve:

![Profile of RABD~660:670max~ using the small ROI.](figures/p_rabd_series.png){width="289"}

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Extract the series
d_rabd <- rabd |>
  extract_spectral_series(
    index = names(rabd),
    calibration = pixel_to_distance(hsi_tools_core),
    extent = rois_sml[1, ])

# Print
d_rabd
```

![Tibble of extracted values.](figures/tibble_series.png){width="397"}

## Spectral profile

Similarly, You can extract the data that was used to plot this curve:

![](figures/p_spectrum.png){width="347"}

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Extract reflectance profile
d_reflectance <- reflectance |>
  # Extract profile
  extract_spectral_profile(extent = rois_sml[1, ])

# Print
d_reflectance
```

![](figures/spectral_profile_full.png)

Or if you'd like to get the index value, for example to use for calibration:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# Extract single RABD value
d_rabd_value <- rabd |>
  extract_spectral_profile(extent = rois_sml[1, ])

# Print
d_rabd_value
```

![](figures/spectral_profile_rabd.png){width="188"}
